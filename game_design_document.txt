# Ecosphere Cascade: $3 Steam Release Game Design Document

## Executive Summary
Ecosphere Cascade is a casual physics-based puzzle game inspired by Peggle, with an environmental restoration theme. Players shoot water drops from a crossbow to hit seed pegs, growing trees and transforming a polluted landscape into a thriving ecosystem. This document outlines the minimal viable product (MVP) for a $3 Steam release.

## Genre
Casual Physics Puzzle / Peggle-like with Environmental Theme

## Target Audience
- Casual gamers looking for relaxing, satisfying gameplay
- Puzzle game enthusiasts
- Players interested in environmental themes
- Ages 10+
- Price-conscious Steam users seeking quality indie games under $5

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. Aim crossbow at seed pegs using trajectory prediction line
2. Shoot water drop (limited to 10 shots per level)
3. Water drop bounces off obstacles (rocks, rotating rocks, curved blocks)
4. Hit seed pegs to grow trees and score points
5. Chain hits for combo multipliers
6. Clear all seed pegs to win, or run out of shots to lose
7. Watch environment transform from polluted to natural as trees grow

**Our Advantage at $3:**
- Unique environmental theme
- Satisfying physics gameplay proven by Peggle
- Lower price point than main competitors
- Simple, accessible mechanics
- No F2P monetization tricks

## Risk Assessment
**Technical Risks:**
- LOW: Using proven Godot 4 engine with existing prototype
- LOW: Physics already implemented and working

**Market Risks:**
- MEDIUM: Crowded casual puzzle market on Steam
- LOW: $3 price point reduces barrier to entry
- MEDIUM: Need good store page and visibility

**Development Risks:**
- LOW: Scope is well-defined and achievable
- MEDIUM: Solo/small team development timeline
- LOW: Most core features already prototyped

## Conclusion
Ecosphere Cascade is well-positioned as a $3 Steam release. The core mechanics are already implemented and fun. By focusing on 12 polished levels, proper progression systems, and satisfying feedback, we can deliver a quality experience that justifies the price point while keeping scope manageable. The environmental theme provides a unique angle in the physics puzzle space, and the Peggle-inspired gameplay is proven to be engaging and replayable.
